# Next Word Prediction with LSTM RNN and GRU RNN

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a next word prediction model using two popular recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The model has been trained on the Shakespeare-Hamlet text from the NLTK Gutenberg corpus, so the predicted outputs will be in the context of Shakespearean language.

## Prediction Explanation
The model uses an RNN architecture to learn the patterns and dependencies in the Shakespeare-Hamlet text corpus. The LSTM and GRU units are designed to capture long-term dependencies in the data, which is crucial for accurate next word prediction.

## Prediction Explanation
The model uses an RNN architecture to learn the patterns and dependencies in the input text corpus. The LSTM and GRU units are designed to capture long-term dependencies in the data, which is crucial for accurate next word prediction.
During the training process, the model learns to map input sequences of words to their corresponding next words. When you provide an input sequence, the model uses its learned knowledge to predict the most likely next word based on the patterns it has identified in the training data.
